This repository contains modeling results for two battery models with different fidelity levels, employed in the study 
**"Health-Conscious Charging of Lithium-ion Batteries Using Bayesian Optimization Guided by a Semi-Empirical Aging Model"**
The models aim to capture the degradation behavior of lithium-ion batteries under various charging conditions while maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.
